# EPR Reference Environment

The EPR Reference Environment is a public available test environment which is also used for the Swiss projektathon. Vendors of primary systems can use the EPR Reference Environment for isolated tests (no peer) of the EPR confomal transactions and exchange formats.

While the EPR Reference Environment provides a rich coverage of no peer tests to verify the EPR compliance, the no peer tests have limited support for data exchange in real use cases (e.g., echange of document between different primary systems).

The EPR reference environment is currently available with the URL [EPR reference environment][ref-env].
