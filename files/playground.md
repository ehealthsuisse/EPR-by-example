# EPR Playground

The EPR Playground is a sponsored project provided by the BfH Medizininformtik in Biel to provide a testbed for the implementation of Use Cases on the Swiss EPR. It provides the components and actors of a typical EPR community it-infrastructure with a focus on patient management and document sharing.   

The characteristics of the EPR Playground are:
- no registration required. Knowing the endpoints is all you need to connect to the EPR Playground.
- mTLS authentication is not required. The endpoints can be accessed without exchanging X.509 certificates.
- Authoritzation is deactivaed to lower the gap and complexity of Use Cases.
